Hey everyone, my name is Ryan Walters.  I studied Supply Chain Management at the University of South Carolina and though we discussed analytics to great length, it never included us using modern tools for that purpose.  After college I was working my tail off and didn't have the time or money to pursue any further education.  Now that the dust has settled, I have taken the opportunity to dip my feet into the coding world with Tech Talent South.

Some other facts about me:
- I was born in Maryland and lived there in Northern Baltimore County until I left for college.
- I spent my summers in Ocean City, MD, for a few summers through highschool and college.
- I've been a bus boy, in IT helpdesk, and an Industrial Engineer at UPS.
- I spend most of my free time with my dog and friends at breweries, gaming, at the dog park, or at the gym.
- I'm currently working in Operations at a Mortgage Company, ICG, here in Charlotte, NC, and am a licensed Loan Officer in most of the US.
